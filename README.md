# Links üîó
**It is recommended that you do not use the offical GitHub Page since the duplicates are just embeds. The duplicate websites are just so if they get blocked on school computers you can use the backups**
- You can also just enable popups so the website can be opened with about:blank
- [Original GitHub Site recommended for at home](https://n-jramirez.github.io/)
- [Google Site 1](https://sites.google.com/view/njramirez/home)
- [Google Site 2](https://sites.google.com/view/n-jramirez/home)
- [Google Site 3](https://sites.google.com/view/unflash/home)
# Version 1.1 ‚öíÔ∏è
- [about:blank](https://about:blank) redirect if popups are allowed, used so the website is less likely to get blocked at school. (**recommended that you do the same**)
